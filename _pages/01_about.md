You have reached blog's *About Me* page. Apart from telling that he's a ***software developer*** working for ***S&P Global Market Intelligence*** and that he works on Open Source & Data Science projects in his spare time, the author is too lazy to write anymore currently. You can find him lurking in ***Machine Learning*** and ***Data Science*** Twitter community.
